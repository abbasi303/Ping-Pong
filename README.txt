Ping Pong Score Counter
This is a simple web-based application that allows you to keep track of the score of a ping pong game. The application uses html, css, bulma and javascript to create a user-friendly and responsive interface. The application features two buttons for each player to increment or decrement their score, a reset button to start a new game, and a display that shows the current score and the winner.

How to use
To use the application, open the index.html file in your browser.
To increase your score, click on the “+” button below your name. To decrease your score, click on the “-” button below your name.
To reset the score and start a new game, click on the “Reset” button on the top right corner of the screen.
To see the current score and the winner, look at the display on the top left corner of the screen. The winner is the first player to reach 11 points or more with a difference of at least 2 points from the other player.
